# Swipes navigation #
Android project that demonstrates 4-directions swipe navigation as into my [Urban Curiosity](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.visionapps.urban "Urban Curiosity") application.
By 4-directions swipe navigation I mean the UI with a central part from which you can navigate to left, right, top and bottom areas with a swipe gesture.

Quick video demo of the 4-directions swipe navigation:
